# A shiny app for Tageted Maximum Likelihood Estimation

## What are the results

This app uses simulated data to train a SuperLerner in the TMLE procedure. (A) Propensity score compared among those individuals treated with A or B treatment. (B) Comparison between SuperLearner and individual learners estimating E[Y|A,W]. (C) Average Treatment Estimation (D) Average treatment for treated (E) Average Treatment for Controls. (F) Risk Ratio (G) Odd Ratio.
